Remini is an ongoing attempt to create a simple, lightweight real-time Markdown Renderer in Qt Widgets. The primary goal of this app is note taking for programming purposes. Reading and understanding codes and cli-commands are made easy using QSyntaxHighlighter and custom Markdown Renderer. Taking notes and editing are made easy by the real-time cursor detection which either shows the Markdown symbols per line when editing and hides the symbols in other lines.
